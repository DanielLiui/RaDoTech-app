# RaDoTech device app
By Qayam Damji, Daniel Liu, and Daniel Tam

A simulated Qt app that guides RaDoTech device users on how to scan themselves using the Radotech device. 
Algorithms are supposed to process the user's health data and then users can view the health 
performance of different parts of their body as well as recommendations. 

Note: the app's analysis of the user's data and the health results shown are simulated with placeholder
data. The app does not contain any complex algorithms that analyze the user's health data.
